I'm interested in applying what I learned to an exciting field such as the gaming industry and digital marketing. For 1, I'm interested in directly with customers and applying data science and machine learning to build solutions to business problems. For 2, web analytics and digital marketing seem to be interesting fields to apply data science. 3 has a particular focus in collection user data to improve player experience in games. This job emphazes on data collection, I would be equally interested in a position in the data analysis team. Overall, I find that most of the data science postings focus on building machine learning models rather than the data science process. I think my interest lies somewhere in the middle of a data scientist and an analyst.

# Task 2: Highs and Lows

I really liked the assignments and final project in this course. I find them to be interesting, practical and connected to the real world. The lecture format is also a plus for me as it is short, well structured and easy to digest. 

Even though I'm not really interested in machine learning, this course presented a new perspective on data science and inspired my interest. I discovered something new that is interesting and widely applicable. I'm planning to pursue graduate studies in data science or related areas to get a better view of the field and hope to get into an industry that I like.
